CharityDonations-AMAL - marketplace for online donations.
This android was created using Dart, Ruby and Flutter. We used a cloud database, Google Firebase to keep things simple and sorted on the database side of things. Flutter was used so the app could be remodeled in an iOS and Android both. 
Users can list any item they want to donate and pick any items they may want to get from the listed items.
This app has an option of chatting with other users so if anyone who wants to get an item, can reach out to the person who posted the item and connect for pick up / drop off details. 
The entire process of UI interface research and design, user experience, following the scrum and agile methodology was followed prior to creating the project.
JIRA was used as project management software
Figma and InVision tools were used for prototype and designing the screens before coding the app.
